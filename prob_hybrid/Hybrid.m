% Debugging tip: You can split your MATLAB code into cells using "%%"
% comments. The cell containing the cursor has a light yellow background,
% and you can press Ctrl+Enter to run just the code in that cell. This is
% useful when projects get more complex and slow to rerun from scratch

close all; % closes all figures

%% Setup
% read images and convert to floating point format
image1 = im2single(imread('data/Afghan_girl_after.jpg'));
image2 = im2single(imread('data/Afghan_girl_before.jpg'));

% Several additional test cases are provided for you, but feel free to make
% your own (you'll need to align the images in a photo editor such as
% Photoshop). The hybrid images will differ depending on which image you
% assign as image1 (which will provide the low frequencies) and which image
% you asign as image2 (which will provide the high frequencies)

%% Filtering and Hybrid Image construction
cutoff_frequency1 = 2; 

%This is the standard deviation, in pixels, of the 
% Gaussian blur that will remove the high frequencies from one image and 
% remove the low frequencies from another image (by subtracting a blurred
% version from the original version). You will want to tune this for every
% image pair to get the best results.
filter1 = fspecial('Gaussian', cutoff_frequency1*4+1, cutoff_frequency1);



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% YOUR CODE BELOW. Use imfilter() to create 'low_frequencies' and
% 'high_frequencies' and then combine them to create 'hybrid_image'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove the high frequencies from image1 by blurring it. The amount of
% blur that works best will vary with different image pairs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

low_frequencies = imfilter(image1,filter1);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove the low frequencies from image2. The easiest way to do this is to
% subtract a blurred version of image2 from the original version of image2.
% This will give you an image centered at zero with negative values.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

high_frequencies = image2-imfilter(image2,filter1);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Combine the high frequencies and low frequencies
